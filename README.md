<Conceptual explanation of alternative states of tree cover in tropics>

This is a model extension of the paper "Are strong fireâ€“vegetation feedbacks needed to explain the spatial distribution of tropical tree cover?" (Good et al., 2016).

Bimodality check using the followings instead of large scale of productivity and mortality of Good 2016:

-Precipitation in function of Tree cover
-Productivity in function of Trecipitation
-Tree cover in function of Productivity
