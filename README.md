This code is for the simulation of the models as part of the master's thesis with title
"Multimodal Tropical Tree Cover States in Monostable Dynamical Systems - Reconsidering theory and observations"
at Technical University of Munich

This code yields the results presented in Chapter 3:
- 3.1 Simulation of Hirota's and Good's models
- 3.2 Results from Variant models in a monostable system
-- 3.2.1 Conceptual monostable model
-- 3.2.2 Extended Good's model
- 3.3 Analysis of observed background variables
