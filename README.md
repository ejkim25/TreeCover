<Conceptual explanation of alternative states of tree cover in tropics>

This is a model extension of the paper "Are strong fireâ€“vegetation feedbacks needed to explain the spatial distribution of tropical tree cover?" (Good et al., 2016).

It involves the bimodality check using different method instead of the "large scale" of productivity and mortality of Good 2016:

Precipitation in function of Tree cover -> Productivity in function of Trecipitation -> Tree cover in function of Productivity

The code contains two different sections. Thus, it's needed to consider them separately:
  1. Fixed P0 and k (manually varying P0 and k)
  2. Multiple P0 and k
